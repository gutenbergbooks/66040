<span class="i0">Thoughts of the night, or tell</span><br />
<span class="i0">The mind's comparing that some things are sad,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For this day all are glad!</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Tis morn, 'tis open morn, the full sun is</span><br />
<span class="i0">Risen from out the abyss</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where last night lay beyond the unseen rim</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of the horizon dim.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now is the bride awaking. Lo! she starts</span><br />
<span class="i0">To feel the day is home</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whose too-near night will put two different hearts</span><br />
<span class="i0">To beat as near as flesh can let them come.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Guess how she joys in her feared going, nor opes</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her eyes for fear of fearing at her joy.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now is the pained arrival of all hopes.</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the half-thought she scarce knows how to toy.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, let her wait a moment or a day</span><br />
<span class="i0">And prepare for the fray</span><br />
<span class="i0">For which her thoughts not ever quite prepare!</span><br />
<span class="i0">With the real day's arrival she's half wroth.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Though she wish what she wants, she yet doth stay.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her dreams yet merged are</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the slow verge of sleep, which idly doth</span><br />
<span class="i0">The accurate hope of things remotely mar.</span>

<span class="i0">Part from the windows the small curtains set</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sight more than light to omit!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Look on the general fields, how bright they lie</span><br />
<span class="i0">Under the broad blue sky,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Cloudless, and the beginning of the heat</span><br />
<span class="i0">Does the sight half ill-treat!</span><br />
<span class="i0">The bride hath wakened. Lo! she feels her shaking</span><br />
<span class="i0">Heart better all her waking!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her breasts are with fear's coldness inward clutched</span><br />
<span class="i0">And more felt on her grown,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That will by hands other than hers be touched</span><br />
<span class="i0">And will find lips sucking their budded crown.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lo! the thought of the bridegroom's hands already</span><br />
<span class="i0">Feels her about where even her hands are shy,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And her thoughts shrink till they become unready.</span><br />
<span class="i0">She gathers up her body and still doth lie.</span><br />
<span class="i0">She vaguely lets her eyes feel opening.</span><br />
<span class="i0">In a fringed mist each thing</span><br />
<span class="i0">Looms, and the present day is truly clear</span><br />
<span class="i0">But to her sense of fear.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Like a hue, light lies on her lidded sight,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And she half hates the inevitable light.</span>

<span class="i0">Or, like a ship's trail in the sea, survive</span><br />
<span class="i0">What made it there to live!</span><br />
<span class="i0">She lies in bed half waiting that her wish</span><br />
<span class="i0">Grow bolder or more rich</span><br />
<span class="i0">To make her rise, or poorer, to oust fear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And she rise as a common day were here.</span><br />
<span class="i0">That she would be a bride in bed with man</span><br />
<span class="i0">The parts where she is woman do insist</span><br />
<span class="i0">And send up messages that shame doth ban</span><br />
<span class="i0">From being dreamed but in a shapeless mist.</span><br />
<span class="i0">She opes her eyes, the ceiling sees above</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shutting the small alcove,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And thinks, till she must shut her eyes again,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Another ceiling she this night will know,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Another house, another bed, she lain</span><br />
<span class="i0">In a way she half guesses; so</span><br />
<span class="i0">She shuts her eyes to see not the room she</span><br />

<span class="i0">That love for its love weaves!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Between her and the ceiling this day's ending</span><br />

<span class="i0">With curious carefulness of inlocked braids,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With hands that in the sun minutely stir,</span><br />
<span class="i0">One works her hair into concerted knots.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Another buttons tight the gown; her hand,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Touching the body's warmth of life, doth band</span><br />
<span class="i0">Her thoughts with the rude bridegroom's hand to be.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The first then, on the veil placed mistily,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lays on her head, her own head sideways leaning,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The garland soon to have no meaning.</span><br />
<span class="i0">The other, at her knees, makes the white shoon</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fit close the trembling feet, and her eyes see</span><br />
<span class="i0">The stockinged leg, road upwards to that boon</span><br />

<span class="i0">To hit the heated pane!</span><br />

<span class="i0">Now flushed and whispering loud sally ye out</span><br />

<span class="i0">Like the inside of the vestment next her skin,</span><br />
<span class="i0">They round her round and fold each crevice in;</span><br />
<span class="i0">They lift her skirts up, as to tease or woo</span><br />

<span class="i0">Back from the church, under a higher sun trod.</span><br />
<span class="i0">These have no more part than a floor or wall</span><br />

<span class="i0">The bridal and the walk back and the feast</span><br />

<span class="i0">And feel for the lipped lair,</span><br />

<span class="i0">On that still cloistered spot</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where only her nightly maiden hand did feign</span><br />
<span class="i0">A pleasure's empty gain.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, of the others, most will whisper at this,</span><br />

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
